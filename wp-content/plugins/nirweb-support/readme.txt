NirWeb support is a great help desk and support plugin for WordPress with full support of WooCommerce

== Description ==

>Aside from news websites, almost all websites of the world require a support system, **do you agree?**
>The reason is the purpose behind establishing a website is expanding relations with users, offering products, and naturally, supporting them in the future. 

So we have agreed that using a support plugin is a need for every website, even yours, dear friend .

**Well!** The question that arises now is what features should a good support plugin have?


[wordpress & woocommerce support plugin Demo](http://demo.nirwp.com/ticket-free)  / user&pass: demo

To respond this question, I will tell you about our support and ticket plugins’ features; see for yourself if the features are sufficient!

**The ability to define infinite departments**
If your website needs various sections (such as sales, support, management, etc.) you need not worry at all; our WordPress support plugin is ready to meet your requirements.

**The ability to define infinite representatives.**
We will still be by your side if you need to add various representatives to your team.


>Complete accordance with **WooCommerce** and **Easy Digital Downloads**

If you want the user to select the product they have bought when sending a ticket, or only buying customers to be able to send tickets… we are still here for you!

**Prepared answers**
Many of users’ questions are repetitive, so the answers will be the same. The solution is to build a prepared answer so that you can answer such tickets in one click and not waste too much time typing 


**Searching the tickets**
Whenever you need to create a ticket based on ID or a subject, perform a search in a jiffy!

All sections being AJAX and therefore doubly beautiful.
We have developed AJAX in all sections resulting in better appearance of sending tickets, searching tickets, etc. which means efficiency alongside beauty for your sake. 

**Floating support icon on the website**
You could select a custom icon in the plugin settings to float in the corner of the web page and remind your users that you have a support system and care about them!
